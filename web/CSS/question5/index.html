                    <h3>Biking</h3>
                    <p>During my free time, I love to take my bike and go to places within or outside my city.
                    I often go on long trips to clear my mind. Not only that, but there is also the physical benefit
                    of the sport, which is very light on the joints and nonetheless really good for conditioning.</p>

                    <h3>Gardening</h3>
                    <p>In my personal opinion, everyone should be able to do at least some sort of
                    gardening. It makes us understand the privileges of modern society and industrialization,
                    as well as raising awareness on the necessity of preserving nature.</p>

                    <h3>Reading</h3>
                    <p>Reading was the second invention that permitted us to pass knowledge down to other generations, as well
                    as being the most efficient one nowadays. Therefore, taking on the habit of reading means
                    we can continuously evolve culturally and as a species overall.</p>

                    <p>Urbanism is the studies of how we plan and build cities, and I believe
                    understanding where we live is the first step in having a better lifestyle, not only
                    individually, but as a community as well.</p>
